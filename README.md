# stack-play
This repository has some docker-compose container stacks for local labs or for playgrounds to test things our.

## Usage

By default we use bleeding container images latest SNAPSHOT.
If you want to use stable versions, just source the stable.env file with:

```bash
source stable.env
```
It sets the environment variables and you can spinup the stacks with the latest stable versions.
